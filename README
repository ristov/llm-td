LLM-TD toolkit and data sets
============================

Introduction
------------
This repository provides an implementation of the LLM-TD algorithm and
Linux security syslog data sets used for evaluating LLM-TD with different
local LLMs. Note that LLM-TD relies on local LLMs which are used through 
Ollama framework, and you have to install Ollama before using LLM-TD.
The data sets are provided in the 'logs' directory and ground truth data 
can be found in the 'ground-truth' directory, while the 'results'
directory contains the templates detected by evaluated approaches.

Here is an example command line for invoking LLM-TD to detect templates
from event log logs/sshd.log with OpenChat LLM:

./llm-td.pl --model=openchat --logfile=logs/sshd.log --script=./llm-query.sh

To learn more about command line options of LLM-TD, execute:

./llm-td.pl --help

The scripts in the 'ground-truth' directory contain regular expressions for
each distinct event type in the event log, and also provide information
about the ground truth and the result produced by each evaluated approach.

For example, to produce a summary about all event types in logs/sshd.log,
execute the following command line:

cat logs/sshd.log | ground-truth/sshd-results.pl

Information about ground truth and results from evaluated approaches are
provided as comments inside the ground truth script. For example, consider 
the following stanza in ground-truth/sshd-results.pl:

  # template: sshd[<*>]: Accepted <*> for <*> from <*> port <*> ssh2
  # openchat: yes (sshd[<*>]: Accepted <*> for <*> from <*> port <*> ssh2)
  # drain: no (two more specific templates detected instead of one)
  # mistral: yes (sshd[<*>]: Accepted <*> for <*> from <*> port <*> ssh2)
  # wizardlm2: no

In the above stanza, 'template' keyword provides the ground truth template,
whereas 'openchat', 'drain', 'mistral', and 'wizardlm2' keywords indicate
if the relevant approach managed to identify the ground truth template.
Note that 'yes' indicates a successful detection according to P1 and P2 
heuristic principles, and after 'yes' the identified template is provided
in brackets. Also, if the detection was not successful, relevant comments
may optionally follow.
